## Project 1 - Customer Clustering - Marketing and Sales
**Goal**: The goal of this project is to clustering customers of a company by their actions using Machine Learning.

**Description**: Description: In this project, I used exploratory data analysis to understand the data and a Machine Learning model called K-means to generate customer clustering.

**Results**: As a result, 4 clusters were obtained, where each cluster represents different purchasing behaviors and moments among customers.
Cluster 0: The highest value group with the fewest customers. They purchase the most and have the highest average ticket. They have high purchasing power and a higher level of education. They prefer shopping by catalog and directly in the store. Their preferred categories are meat and wine. Most do not have children at home and have been registered customers for the longest time.
Cluster 3: This group has a significantly lower average ticket than the previous group but still brings considerable revenue to the company. Customers have a relatively high annual salary, are older, and usually have one child at home. It is the group that most appreciates the wine category and has the highest number of customers.
Cluster 2: This cluster consists of younger customers with lower purchasing power, but they are the most active within the company. It is the group that registered most recently. These customers like to shop during promotions and prefer to shop at the physical store. They enjoy visiting the website, probably to look for promotions. They like gold products more than the other higher-value clusters.
Cluster 1: This is a young group with lower purchasing power and is the least active among all clusters. The company needs to be cautious, as these customers are churning and buying less than before. They are the least responsive to promotional campaigns. This is an important opportunity for the company to run campaigns targeting children's products. This group makes the most purchases during promotions (%). They prefer to shop at the physical store and are the most frequent visitors to the website. They like gold products more than the other higher-value clusters.
